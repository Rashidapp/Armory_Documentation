# Supported Particles

Particle systems are currently in experimental stage and will be further improved.

## Setup

- Armory defaults to GPU particle simulation
- Accessing `Particle Info` material node requires GPU simulation
- To use CPU simulation, set `Properties - Render - Armory Render Path - Renderer - Particles` to `CPU`
- The rendering is always performed using GPU instancing
