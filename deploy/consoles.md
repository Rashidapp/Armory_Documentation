# Deploying to consoles

## Console SDK

If you have access to the PS4, Xbox One or Switch console SDK, contact us to get access to the Kha backends. Due to the nature of console development, a proof that you are a registered Microsoft / Nintendo / Sony developer is required. Afterwards, the Kha console backends are provided for free.


## Xbox (Universal Windows Platform)

Create a new preset in `Properties - Render - Armory Exporter` and select `Custom` target. Enter `windowsapp` into `Khamake` field and select `Direct3D11` graphics API. Hit `Publish` to export Visual Studio project files.

To proceed, install [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/). Make sure to install components for developing UWP applications. Once installed, open the project located at `blend_file_location/build_projectname/windowsapp-build/projectname.sln`.
