## HashLink (C)

Create a new preset in `Properties - Render - Armory Exporter` and select `Windows (C)` target. Hit `Publish` to export Visual Studio project files.

To proceed, install [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/). Make sure to install components for compiling C++ code. Once installed, open the project located at `blend_file_location/build_projectname/windows-hl-build/project_name.sln`.

<div style="width:75%">![](/deploy/img/windows/1.jpg)</div>

Next, you can test, debug and profile your project in Visual Studio. When you are ready to export final binary, switch to Release mode and build the project.

Once the build process finishes, copy the resulting binary from `x64/Release` folder (in this case `untitled.exe`).

<div style="width:75%">![](/deploy/img/windows/3.jpg)</div>

To the `blend_file_location/build_projectname/windows-hl` folder which also contains game assets.

<div style="width:75%">![](/deploy/img/windows/4.jpg)</div>

You can now package and distribute this folder.
