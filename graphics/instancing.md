# Instancing

Use instancing for fast rendering of linked object duplicates.

- To enable instancing, select object and set `Properties - Object - Armory Props - Instanced Children` to the attributes you need. Only the selected attributes can vary between the instances.
- To create duplicate, click `Menu - Object - Duplicate Linked (Alt D)`
- Parent newly created duplicate to the original object
