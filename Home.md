Hello! I have no idea how to reply to you, please consider opening an issue instead. I am aware of Godot and I like Godot. However, please note Godot is a stand-alone engine while Armory is operated exclusively in Blender, aiming a different workflow. Also, there does not seem to be plans for Vulkan/D3D12 in Godot, which I consider essential for further higher-end 3D graphics development, which this project is focusing on.
