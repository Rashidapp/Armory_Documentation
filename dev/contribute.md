## Local Armory setup

When working on Armory patches, it is useful to setup the SDK locally and apply your modification there.

*Note: Disable `Armory Project - Flags - Cache Build` to always recompile the project when you hit `Play`. There is no need to compile Armory itself, you will see the changes in action instantly.*

#### Armory

- Fork and clone the [armory repository](https://github.com/armory3d/armory) into `blend_location/Libraries/armory`, it will automatically get picked up for that project

#### Iron

- Fork and clone the [iron repository](https://github.com/armory3d/iron) into `blend_location/Libraries/iron`, it will automatically get picked up for that project

### HaxeBullet

- Setup and Update Guide [HaxeBullet Documentation](haxebullet.md)

#### Full SDK

Alternatively, you can clone the whole SDK at once.

- Clone [armsdk](https://github.com/armory3d/armsdk) into `blend_location/armsdk`, it will automatically get picked up for that project - this lets you have a fully self-contained and portable project setup

- You can also point Armory to use the armsdk [at specific location](gitversion?id=manual-clone)

To edit docs locally, clone [armory_docs](https://github.com/armory3d/armory_docs) repository like described in the [Creating a pull request](https://armory3d.org/manual/#/dev/contribute?id=creating-a-pull-request) section. Afterwards, you can drag and drop `.md` files into KodeStudio which comes bundled with Armory SDK. Click `Open Preview to the Side (Ctrl + K V)` button to preview the changes.
